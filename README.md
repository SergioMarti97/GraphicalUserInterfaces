## Graphical User Interfaces or GUIs by Sergio Martí Torregrosa
<p>What is a GUI? GUI is the acronym for Graphical User Interface, and the name
says it all. Is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with the 
program through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, 
instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation</p>
